# MemeMe_2.0

An attempt at Udacity's MemeMe 2.0 project, with a few extras:

1. Instructions rather than just "Top/Bottom" text for the welcome screen
2. An alert when hitting Cancel to give the user a chance to change their mind instead of aggressively discarding the work
3. Highlighting the area where text is to be entered so it's easier to see
