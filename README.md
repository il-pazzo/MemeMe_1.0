# MemeMe_2.0

An attempt at Udacity's MemeMe 2.0 project, with one extra:

1. Add action button on detail screen to allow for multiple actions.
   (That is, if one wants to save the meme to their photo library
   AND text it AND email it, they would otherwise be out of luck
   since the meme editor allows exactly one action before bailing.)
